                <p class="font-medium text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600"><span class="font-bold">Real Madrid </span>claimed their thirteenth <span class="font-bold">Spanish Super Cup</span> and the first title of the season in Riyadh, after beating Barcelona in the final. <span class="font-bold"> Ancelotti's</span> side put in a superb performance at the Al-Awwal Park stadium and brought home another trophy to the club's trophy cabinet. <span class="font-bold"> Vini Jr.</span> played a key role with his first-half display, netting three goals, two of them in the space of three minutes. Lewandowski pulled one back, but <span class="font-bold"> Rodrygo</span> made it 4-1 in the 64th minute.</p><br>
                <p class="font-medium text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600"><span class="font-bold">Real Madrid</span> showed they wouldn't waste any time as they went 2-0 up inside 10 minutes thanks to an attacking display from <span class="font-bold"> Vini Jr. Bellingham</span> threaded a pinpoint pass in behind the defence to the Brazilian, who carried into the area and finished a one-on-one with Iñaki Peña to make it 1-0 with seven minutes on the clock. In the following move, Rodrygo went close to scoring with a right-footed effort that the goalkeeper cleared off the line. It was 2-0 in the 10th minute as <span class="font-bold">Carvajal</span>  played a great pass from his own half to pick out <span class="font-bold">Rodrygo</span> , whose low cross to the far post was met by Vini Jr's left-footed shot.</p><br>
                <p class="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600 font-bold">Vini Jr's hat-trick</p>
                <p class="font-medium text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">Xavi's side fought back with Ferrán Torres' shot against the crossbar, and he had another attempt minutes later, but this time it was kept out by <span class="font-bold">Lunin</span>. The Ukrainian couldn't do anything about a first-time volley from the edge of the area by Lewandowski, who made it 2-1. That wasn't the end of the first half, however, as <span class="font-bold">Vini Jr</span> . completed his hat-trick before the break. Araujo brought him down inside the area, the referee pointed to the spot and the Brazilian converted with his right foot to cap off a spectacular first half (3-1).</p><br>
                <p class="font-medium text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">After a frantic first half, the second half was a much calmer affair and saw fewer chances created. The Whites still looked to add to their score and got their reward in the 64th minute. <span class="font-bold">Valverde</span>  played a deep cross to <span class="font-bold">Vini Jr</span>. whose cutback was half-cleared by Kounde to <span class="font-bold">Rodrygo</span> who side-footed in the loose ball to make it 4-1. </p><br>
                <p class="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600 font-bold">Madrid in control</p>
                <p class="font-medium text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600"><span class="font-bold">Brahim</span> was introduced on 77’ and two minutes later the forward almost grabbed a fifth for his side. <span class="font-bold">Kroos </span> won the ball back and picked out the Malaga-born player who drove into the box, weaved his way past De Jong with a neat turn, but his effort was blocked by Iñaki Peña. The rebound fell to Bellingham who narrowly missed the target. Barcelona looked to reduce the deficit when João Felix flicked the ball over the defender and his low drive was well saved by Lunin with his feet with ten minutes left on the clock. <span class="font-bold">Real Madrid</span>  defended solidly for the closing minutes to secure the victory and lift the Spanish Super Cup in Riyadh.</p>
